## Magnetic Materials:

Some atoms have an unpaired electron possessing intrinsic angular momentum such as Fe (iron)

According to the quantum mechanics, the atomic spin can only hold two valus of opposite sign. s and -s. Those also
can be considered as +1 and -1, respectively.

If t spin of material are aligned, the sum of all atomic spins will produce a net magnetic moment of the material: $<M>$.
