# ISING-MODEL
The Ising model is a model for magnetic materials in physics. Also, this model can be used aa phase transition idea and universality. In this project, we will simulate a spin system to compute the energy, magnetization, and specific heat. Another goal is following Curie temperature in which we have a phase transition.
